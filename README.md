# Off The Mark

This notebook covers the data cleaning and analysis for the NPR series "Off The Mark".

Data comes from the [Historical Marker Database](https://www.hmdb.org/) was launched by J.J. Prats in 2006. It includes over 180,000 active markers in the United States, contributed by thousands of hobbyists. Anyone who sees a marker can take a photo and submit it to the website. Entries are [reviewed by editors](https://www.hmdb.org/about.asp#Editorial) to make sure that the marker is permanent, is located outdoors and has information beyond just names, dates and titles.
