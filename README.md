# Off The Mark

This notebook covers the data cleaning and analysis for the NPR series "Off The Mark".

Data comes from the [Historical Marker Database](https://www.hmdb.org/), which was launched by J.J. Prats in 2006. It has over 180,000 markers, contributed by thousands of hobbyists from all over the country. Anyone who sees a marker can take a photo and submit it to the website. Entries are [reviewed by editors](https://www.hmdb.org/about.asp#Editorial) to make sure that the marker is permanent, located outdoors, and has information beyond just names, dates, and titles.
